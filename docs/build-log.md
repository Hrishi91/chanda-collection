# Build log (append-only, oldest first)

## 2026-07-23 — Project bootstrap

- Requirements gathered from Hrishi (chat): shops/persons/members with
  pledged amounts + installments; road/toto/bus daily collections
  (bus = name + number); collector expenses; 10 collector phones; one
  central final report; Bengali+English; data must live in Google Drive;
  yearly reuse.
- Architecture decided: offline-first PWA + Apps Script/Google Sheet
  (see PROJECT_CONTEXT.md for causes). Voice entry Option B
  (guided + confirm) approved by Hrishi.
- Repo scaffolded: discipline docs, pre-commit docs hook, directories.

## 2026-07-23 — v1 PWA core (offline entry + reports)

- Built the full offline PWA: app shell (index.html, sw.js, manifest,
  SVG icon), IndexedDB layer (`js/db.js`), bn/en i18n (`js/i18n.js`),
  Bengali/English amount-word parser (`js/numparse.js`), shared
  aggregation (`js/aggregate.js`), Web Speech wrapper (`js/voice.js`),
  sync client (`js/sync.js`), and the guided chat-style entry engine +
  all views (`js/app.js`).
- Flows: new shop/person/member (pledge + first installment), bulk shop
  (sticky side), add payment, road/toto/bus daily (bus name+number),
  general + collection expenses. Summary-confirm before every save;
  editable per-field from summary.
- Tests: `node tests/run.js` → 49 passed, 0 failed (parser incl.
  পাঁচশো/সাড়ে তিনশো/দেড় হাজার; aggregation incl. dues + by-collector).
- Live-verified in browser (mobile viewport): onboarding → shop entry
  with "পাঁচশো"→₹500 word parse → save → খাতা list (₹200/₹500, বাকি
  ₹300) → installment "তিনশো" → ₹500/₹500 ✅ → report totals correct;
  unsynced badge counts 3.

## 2026-07-23 — Google Sheets backend + user guides

- `apps-script/Code.gs`: doPost push with LockService + upsert-by-uuid
  (safe retries, no duplicates from 10 concurrent phones), doGet dump
  (year-filtered, client aggregates with the same aggregate.js), setup()
  sheet creator, dailyBackup() → Drive folder JSON snapshots. Secret in
  Script Properties, never in the repo.
- Guides: `docs/user-guide/setup-google.md` (owner, one-time deploy),
  `docs/user-guide/collector-guide.md` (Bengali, for the 10 collectors).
- Not yet live-tested against a real deployment — needs Hrishi's Google
  account (tracked in pending.md).

## 2026-07-23 — v2 Phase 1: login, roles, admin approval

- Server (`apps-script/Code.gs` rewritten): Users sheet (salted SHA-256
  password hash + rotating login token), actions register/login/
  changePassword/push/dump + admin listUsers/setStatus/approveYear/
  setCashier/resetPassword; makeAdmin() editor bootstrap; shared SECRET
  removed — every data call now needs an approved user's token; yearly
  access via `years` list on the user.
- Client: `js/auth.js` (session in localStorage — one online login,
  then offline works), `js/config.js` (baked SCRIPT_URL), login/
  register/forgot/change-password views, forced password change after
  admin reset, 👑 admin panel (approve/block/cashier flag/reset pw/
  year access), logout guarded against unsynced entries. Secret field
  dropped from Settings. sw.js → chanda-v2.0.0.
- Verified live against a node mock of the exact protocol
  (scratchpad/mock-backend.js): register → pending login rejected →
  admin approve in UI → login ok; pre-login sync rejected (bad-token),
  post-login autosync pushed 3 queued entries; wrong password, year
  2027 gate, stale-token admin call all rejected; password change +
  re-login ok. 49 unit tests still passing.

## 2026-07-23 — Live on GitHub Pages

- Repo published: github.com/Hrishi91/chanda-collection (public,
  Hrishi created it + enabled Pages from main//root himself).
- Live install link verified in browser (login screen renders):
  https://hrishi91.github.io/chanda-collection/
- Remaining to go fully live: Hrishi's Apps Script deploy → bake URL
  into js/config.js → real e2e sync test → collectors install.
